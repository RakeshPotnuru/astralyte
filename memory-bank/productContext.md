# Product Context: Astralyte

## Why This Project Exists

Astralyte addresses the need for intelligent, comprehensive research assistance. Traditional research methods can be time-consuming, fragmented, and overwhelming. By leveraging multiple AI agents working in concert, Astralyte aims to streamline the research process and deliver more thorough results.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Information Overload**: Helps users navigate vast amounts of information efficiently
2. **Research Fragmentation**: Consolidates research from multiple perspectives and sources
3. **Time Constraints**: Accelerates the research process through parallel agent processing
4. **Quality Assurance**: Multiple agents can verify and cross-reference information

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

1. User enters a research query or topic
2. Multi-agent system orchestrates research tasks
3. Agents collaborate to gather, verify, and synthesize information
4. Results are presented in an organized, digestible format
5. User can dive deeper into specific areas or export findings

### Agent Collaboration Model

- **Research Agents**: Gather information from various sources
- **Verification Agents**: Cross-check facts and sources
- **Synthesis Agents**: Combine findings into coherent narratives
- **Presentation Agents**: Format and organize output for user consumption

## User Experience Goals

- **Simplicity**: Clean, intuitive interface that doesn't overwhelm
- **Transparency**: Show how agents are working and what sources are used
- **Control**: Allow users to guide research direction
- **Trust**: Build confidence through citation and verification
- **Efficiency**: Minimize time from question to answer
