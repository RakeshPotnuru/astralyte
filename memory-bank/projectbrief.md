# Project Brief: Astralyte

## Project Overview

Astralyte is a multi-agent research engine that transforms any topic into a structured, citation-backed research brief within minutes. Built for clarity, speed, and reliability, Astralyte uses a coordinated chain of AI agents—each specializing in a distinct research task—to automate the full research workflow end-to-end.

Astralyte automates research through a four-agent pipeline:

1. Scout (Agent A)

Discovers credible sources and gathers high-level context.

2. Summarizer (Agent B)

Breaks each source into structured components—key points, claims, data, limitations.

3. Analyst (Agent C)

Identifies contradictions, themes, and deeper insights across sources.

4. Synthesizer (Agent D)

Produces a polished research brief with sections, implications, and citations.

This modular system delivers consistent, high-quality research results in seconds.

## Core Goals

1. Provide an intuitive interface for conducting research
2. Leverage multi-agent architecture for comprehensive research capabilities
3. Deliver accurate, factual, and well-organized research results
4. Enable users to explore topics deeply with AI assistance
