# Active Context: Astralyte

## Current Focus

### Immediate Priority

- Project initialization and foundation setup
- Memory bank documentation establishment
- Base architecture decisions

### Active Development Area

None currently - project is in initial setup phase.

## Recent Changes

### Latest Updates

- **Memory Bank Initialized**: Core documentation files created
  - `projectbrief.md` - Project scope and goals
  - `productContext.md` - Product vision and UX goals
  - `techContext.md` - Technical stack documentation
  - `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and coding patterns
  - `activeContext.md` - This file (current context)
  - `progress.md` - Development progress tracker

### Recent Decisions

1. **File Naming**: Using kebab-case for component and utility files
2. **Function Syntax**: Using `function` declarations over arrow functions for components
3. **Component Structure**: Components in `shadcn/` subdirectory for UI primitives

## Current Considerations

### Technical

- Need to set up agent orchestration system
- Decide on AI/LLM integration approach
- Plan API structure for multi-agent communication

### UX/Design

- Design research input interface
- Plan agent activity visualization
- Consider progressive disclosure for complex results

## Blockers

None currently.

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Design initial UI mockups/wireframes
2. [ ] Implement basic research input interface
3. [ ] Set up agent orchestration architecture
4. [ ] Choose and integrate AI/LLM provider
5. [ ] Build first research agent prototype

## Notes & Reminders

- Accessibility is a core requirement
- Keep components simple and composable
- Document decisions in memory bank as project evolves
